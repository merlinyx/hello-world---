1. (based on the oxform cam api) Have your face become bigger today?
use the face data to calculate the area of face and compare results with the day before

2. build an app for showing hours of school libraries and other facilities
because it's annoying when you need to go to school websites everytime you want to know the hours of a lib
especially when on holidays and sometimes it is not even correct online

3. a to do list with a function to set the importance of the task
but I guess it is already existent it's just I haven't searched for it

4. I genuinely hope there will be a better AI personal assistant. My life will be much easier with someone like that. 
Well, this is just a too audacious hope. Or maybe not? who knows.

5. I hope all digital devices will become eyes-friendly.

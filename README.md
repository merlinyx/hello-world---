# It's a private repo. 
Just random stuff huh. 


Well the following is from me like a year ago.
## hello-world---
I'm doing the intro right now!
Hey everyone! It is my first time using GitHub, but I have heard of its name about 5 years ago. So it is really exciting for me to type right now in a repository which lives on Github! haha
Right now I am Class of 2019 at Columbia. I'm from Nanjing in China and I can speak Japanese as well. I love music! Looking forward to knowing new people! Have a good day!
